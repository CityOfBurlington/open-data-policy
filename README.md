Once the final language is complete and the policy is enacted, the policy and specification will be placed back on Github as well as on the City's website at https://www.burlingtonvt.gov and open data portal to be hosted at data.burlingtonvt.gov.

**Expectations**

This posting of the draft Open Data Policy is an opportunity to garner greater input and feedback from communinity stakeholders before the policy is finalized.

There should be certain expectations about the ability to change verbatim whatever your suggestion or input may be. Given that the policy and specfication must go through the Mayor's office, and other relevant and/or oversight entities such as the Department Information Technology and the City Attorney's office, some suggestions may be interpreted or translated to match required legal terms and definitions.
