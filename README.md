Open Data Policy
================

**Background**

The City of Burlington is opening a process of co-creation with the public to develop an open data policy. The goal of the policy to establish a formal governance processes to make public data-sharing institutional and sustainable.

**Timeline**

The comment period for the City of Burlington's Open Data Policy Oct 15-31, 2019. Your input is greatly appreciated. Our goal is to draft the policy and have it approved by the end of the calendar year. The approved policy will be kept on GitHub as well as on the City's website at https://www.burlingtonvt.gov. Our open data portal will be hosted through OpenDataSoft and is expected to launch by the end of 2019.

**Expectations**

This posting of the draft Open Data Policy is an opportunity to garner greater input and feedback from community stakeholders before the policy is finalized.

Given that the policy will ultimately go through the Mayor's office, and other relevant and/or oversight entities such as the Department Information Technology and the City Attorney's office, some suggestions may be interpreted or translated to match required legal terms and definitions.
