Open Data Policy
================

**Background**

The City of Burlington is opening a process of co-creation with the public to develop an open data policy. The goal of the policy to establish a formal governance processes to make public data-sharing institutional and sustainable.

**Timeline**

The comment period for the City of Burlington's Open Data Policy **Oct 15-31, 2019**. After the comment period closes, all suggusttions and proposed edits will be taken from Github on October 31, 2019 in order to be draft the final policy. Once the final language is complete and the policy is enacted, the policy and specification will be placed back on Github as well as on the City's website at https://www.burlingtonvt.gov and open data portal to be hosted through [OpenDataSoft](https://www.opendatasoft.com/) and expencted to launch by the end of the calendar year.

**Expectations**

This posting of the draft Open Data Policy is an opportunity to garner greater input and feedback from communinity stakeholders before the policy is finalized.

There should be certain expectations about the ability to change verbatim whatever your suggestion or input may be. Given that the policy and specfication must go through the Mayor's office, and other relevant and/or oversight entities such as the Department Information Technology and the City Attorney's office, some suggestions may be interpreted or translated to match required legal terms and definitions.
